	<dt>Purpose</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The purpose of Call Bubbie is to support  transgender people, individuals of marginalized genders, and women who navigate <a href="https://www.hearing-voices.org/#content" target="_blank">non-consensus realities</a> and/or suicidality.</p>
		<p>Rooted in the values of community mental health, disability justice, and transformative justice, we are a collective of poor and working-class individuals offering free peer services to support and uplift people like us.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Who We Are</dt>

	<dd>
		<p>We are a small but mighty team of two on-the-ground peer support specialists and two subject matter expert advisors, who act as our mentors in the work.</p>

		<p>Our work is rooted in Disability Justice and Transformative Justice; essentially, creating mental health community supports without carceral and punitive intersections.</p>
		
		<p>75% of our team experiences non-consensus reality.</p>

		<p>50% of our team are psychiatric survivors.</p>
		
		<p>75% of our team identify as disabled.</p>
		
		<p>75% of our team identifies as trans or queer.</p>
		
		<p>100% of our team has lived experience with recovery (both mental health recovery and substance recovery.</p>
		
		<p>Our on-the-ground peers include 1 white peer and one mixed-race person of the global majority. Our advisors are both mixed-race and people of the global majority.</p>
	</dd>
	<dd>
		<p>We are based on the land of the Multnomah, Clackamas, Kathlamet, Tualatin Kalapuya, and Molalla people referred to as Multnomah County, OR.</p>

	<dt>Background</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Call Bubbie was founded in 2023 by a peer support specialist who encountered challenges in accessing affirming, community-based resources for a woman they were supporting through extreme states. This woman was a profound source of inspiration, encouraging them to live boldly and never from a place of fear. The experience of supporting her left an indelible mark, leading to the creation of Call Bubbie in her honor. The organization was born from an altered state the founder experienced afterward, with the intention of ensuring that her memory remains a blessing.</p>
