	<dt>Purpose</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The purpose of Call Bubbie is to serve queer and effeminate folks in Multnomah County, Oregon who experience altered states. Altered states include suicidality, depression/anxiety, and experiences that fall under the "Hearing Voices" umbrella (sensations, beliefs, and thoughts that are considered "unusual").</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Background</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Call Bubbie was started in 2023 by a peer who was not able to get the affirming-community resources for a woman they were working with who experienced altered states. This woman was very inspirational for them and impressed on them to never live from a place of fear. Call Bubbie was born from the altered state this peer experienced in order to make sure their client's memory was a blessing. </p>
