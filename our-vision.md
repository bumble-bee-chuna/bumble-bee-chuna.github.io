	<dt>Community visits</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Community visits serve to reconnect community members who are experiencing emergent mental health crisis and are self-scheduled. These visits normally are 1.5 hours of active listening from a pair of certified peer support specialists. Referral to longer term supports are made to our regularly held peer support groups as well as supports catalogued in our Resource Library.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Peer Support Groups</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>We host 2 peer support groups, Hearing Voices (HVN) and Alternative 2 Suicide (Alt2Su). We are certified to host these groups through <a href="https://wildfloweralliance.org/" target="_blank">Wildflower Alliance</a>.</p>

    <dt>Resource Library</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>In Multnomah County, we found mental health resource information was heavily scattered and saw the need to create a centralized database of free and sliding scale community offerings.</p> 

		<p>The offerings we have catalogued are primarily mental health related, SUD recovery related, and social activities that people can engage in that are not cost prohibitive. We also catalogue material resources that might be more difficult to access through 211.</p>
