<p>Our work in 2024 was entirely grassroots funded. In 2024, with $12,000 we completed the following:

<ul>
	<li>Held 18 two hour, free, peer group sessions for Alternatives 2 Suicide (Alt2Su) and Hearing Voices Network (HVN), with 255 people attending and 17 regular members</li>
	<li>Supported 32 community members in crisis</li>
	<li>Cataloged 218 local resources to make them more accessible</li>
	<li>Created 41 mini case management sheets, referring folks to longer term support</li>
</ul>
</p>
